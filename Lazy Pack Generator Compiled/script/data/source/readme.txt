Custom Lazy Pack
Generator script written by Hoverbike
Patch authors include: ChucksFeedAndSeed, Marethyu, Patchanon, OldManKain, theboy181, Sweetmini, MaxLastBreath, StevenssND' }

Generates a patch for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with the desired resolution, framerate, and controller layout selected by the user.
Generated patches are written to the mod folder for TotK and should enable automatically.
Automatically sets TotK to extended memory layout if a resolution above 1080p (e.g. 1440p) is selected.
Automatically sets TotK to 1x scaling in Yuzu, regardless of resolution, as it is always required.

If you experience any issues with the generator app, or with the generated patches, please open an issue on our tracker on the github, or contact me.
